Machine Learning of DNA Methylation Predictors for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)

ASDs are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized, in varying degrees, by restricted interests, repetitive behaviors and impairments in social interaction. There are currently no reliable biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment of ASDs, so they are clinically diagnosed by behavior, making early diagnosis challenging. The average age at diagnosis is more than 3 years, which is much later than ideal. The purpose of my project is to discover potential predictors of ASDs and build predictive models to improve the prediction of ASD diagnosis by examining DNA methylation data. ASD predictors and predictive models will significantly aid in early diagnosis, which makes early intervention possible. And early intervention is crucial as it provides diagnosed children the best chance for improved outcomes.

Machine learning models (e.g. random forest and neural networks) and the caret package in R will be used to create a predictive model based on training and testing data from placenta and brain samples.
